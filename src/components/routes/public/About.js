        <p className="about-paragraph">
          What once was a curious look into "how do websites work exactly?" has
          now snowballed into a passion which is a career path that was waiting
          for me the whole time. I have always been creative with a strong sense
          of logic, and nothing makes those two strengths work in harmony more
          than being a FullStack web developer. I'm a mechanic who can fit a
          powerful engine as well as design beautiful bodywork.

        <p className="about-paragraph">
          Outside of coding, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects,
          writing tech articles, and experimenting with new web technologies. I
          am a natural teacher, and newbies like to come to me for valuable and
          unintimidating advice.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          While I feel at home at a computer, I adore my time out with nature. I
          make use of my "phone prison" to get away and connect with the actual
          reality.
